# Old game
Back in 2007, My mom bought a 14 years old me a "GameMaker" book from the Se-ed bookstore. These two game are the products of that school break.

Around the time I almost done with highschool, I uploaded these games to YOYOgame server to share it with my friend on some high school math forum.

Unfortunately, the server got taken down and the link was dead at somepoint in the mid 2010s. I thought my games was lost forever. I felt sad since building these game was one of my treasured childhood memory that got me into programming.

10 years later, I found out that some IRL hero archived every game on YoYogame sever published before 2014.

Thank you stranger!!
