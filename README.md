# Old game
Back in 2007, My mom bought a 14 years old me a "GameMaker" book from the Se-ed bookstore. These two game are the products of that school break.

Around the time I almost done with highschool, I uploaded these games to YOYOgame server to share it with my friend on some high school math forum.

Unfortunately, the yoyo game server got taken down, and the link became inactive sometime in the mid-2010s. I thought my games were lost forever, which made me sad since creating them was one of my cherished childhood memories and sparked my interest in programming.

However, 10 years later, I discovered that an unsung hero had archived every game on the YOYOgame server published before 2014.

Thank you stranger!!
